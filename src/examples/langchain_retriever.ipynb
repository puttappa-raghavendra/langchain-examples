All  those r oles can be \\nperformed by the same organization, but some of them may be outsourced (with limitations).  \\n \\nFigure 6: Relationship of the various PKI components  \\n1.2.1 Certification Authority (CA)  \\nThe Certification Authority, or Certificate Authority (both names are used interchangeably), is the party that \\nsigns digital certificates.  \\nThere are 2 types of CAs: public and private. Public CAs are those vendors you can find on the Internet \\nwhen you are looking to buy a certificate. Private (a.k.a. Internal) CAs are an IT asset located inside \\norganizations, to create certificates needed by staff and devices for secure operations.  \\n1.2.2 Registration Authority (RA)  \\nThe Registration Authority is the point of contact for anyone who wants to get their certifi cate signed or \\nrevoked by the CA . Signing requires  a co-called Certificate Signing Request (CSR) . The RA is responsible for \\nverifying the request, the authenticity of the requester, ownership of the object for which a certificate is \\nneeded, and performing all other checks to make sure that the request is legitimate and complete.  \\nThe actual creation of the CSR file itself depends on your policy; either the Subscriber creates one \\nthemselves or the RA creates one on their behalf , or a combination thereof . \\nIf the request is accepted, it will be passed to the CA to sign the certificate.', metadata={'source': 'https://www.first.org/resources/guides/Establishing-a-Certification-Authority-CA.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content='Thailand National Root Certification Authority : Thailand NRCA  \\nElectronic Transactions Development Agency  Establishing a CA  \\n \\nPublication  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEstablishing a Certification Authority ( CA) \\nVersion 1.1', metadata={'source': 'https://www.first.org/resources/guides/Establishing-a-Certification-Authority-CA.pdf', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='Thailand National Root Certification Authority : Thailand NRCA  \\nElectronic Transactio ns Development Agency  Establishing a CA  \\n \\n- 21 - \\n \\n2) Certification Practice Statement (CPS)  \\nThis document describes the implementation of the above policy. Each CA (Root CA and any \\nIntermediate  CA) needs to create their own CPS.  These practice statements do not necessarily have \\nto be separate documents, but all services must be individually covered.  \\n \\nFigure 10: Relationship between CP and CPS  \\nThese together detail how the CA implemented the requirements and Best Practices to operate in a secure \\nand trustworthy manner.  \\nWhile the CP describes the options that may be used , and their minimum requirements, or stipulates that \\nthe CPS shall cover the detail s of items, it is important to realize that the CPS must describe exactly which \\nof the options are actually used and how . \\nEach CPS describes the policy implementation for their own lower level certificates.  So the Root CPS details \\nhow Intermediate certific ates are handled, while the Intermediate CAs will talk about Subscriber certificates.  \\nExamples of CP and CPS documents are easy to find, as Public Root CAs are required to publish theirs \\nonline on their websites4. \\nIf RFC 7382 is followed, the CP/CPS covers  the following areas:  \\n1) Introduction  \\nDescribes the CA itself, Overview , Document Name and Identification, PKI Participants, Certificate \\nUsage, Policy Administration, and Definitions and Acronyms.  \\n2) Publication and Repository Responsibilities  \\nDescribes Reposito ries, Publication of Certification Information, Time or Frequency of Publication, \\nand Access Controls on Repositories.  \\n                                                 \\n4 Thailand NRCA’s CP and CPS: https://www.nrca.go.th/publish.html', metadata={'source': 'https://www.first.org/resources/guides/Establishing-a-Certification-Authority-CA.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content=\"Thailand National Root Certification Authority : Thailand NRCA  \\nElectronic Transactio ns Development Agency  Establishing a CA  \\n \\n- 49 - \\n \\n5.1 Trust Service Providers  \\nUnder the EU eIDAS  regulation the definition of a trust service is:  \\nAn electronic service normally provided for remuneration which consists of:  \\n1) the creation, verification, and validation of electronic signatures, electronic seals or electronic \\ntimestamps, electronic registered delivery services and certificates related t o those services, or  \\n2) the creation, verification , and validation of certificates for website authentication; or  \\n3) the preservation of electronic signatures, seals or certificates related to those services.  \\nTSPs (Trust Service Providers) provide a combinati on of the above services – some only issue digital \\ncertificates, others provide electronic signature services as well. What is important is that all TSPs adhere \\nto the strict requirements that ensure the validity and security of the certificates, keys , and signatures they \\nprovide.   \\nTSPs must operate to a set of standards to ensure the security and validity of the certificates and \\nauthentication services they offer.
